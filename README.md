Automating on Junos OS with Microsoft PowerShell

Automating JunOS with Microsoft PowerShell has it's own advantages. The biggest single advantage is because 99% of the enterprise environments are running MS Windows. 
that saves us from installing external libraries and internet access for lib installation. 
there are at some points you need to get permissoin from different teams in order to install libraries, e.g, cyber security, applications or desktop support. 
with MS PowerShell most of the common libs are already installed and supported by MS. 

the aim here is to limit the depenedcy on external libs installation and keep the code as much as possible to the in-built libs.
